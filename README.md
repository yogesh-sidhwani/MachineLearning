Python libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib
ML library scikit-learn
Jupyter


System Setup
------------
Setup a Virtual env
Install Virtual Environment

Data
----
The root folder contains matches.csv and deliveries.csv.


Start Project
--------------
Run jupyter notebook from inside the project root.


Description
------------
The major focus is on Data Analysis and Feature Sampling using different PreProcessors.
Model1 - Predict Match Winner using only matches.csv.
Model2 - Predict Match Winner using both matches.csv and deliveries.csv.
Model3 - Predict any target using both of the data files.
The slides.html for different model in code slides folder is created using slideshow in Jupyter notebook.
